# BTEWebQuest<br>A web application for the band Break the Earth

***

[Visit the site!](https://breaktheearth.herokuapp.com/)

### Developed by Hiram Viezca & Shawn Fradet

<p>This project was designed by Hiram Viezca and Shawn Fradet as part of their Computer Programming
Senior Capstone at Grand Canyon University. The idea behind the capstone project is to create
an application that serves as a demonstration of skills learned during the course of their
degree program. Hiram and Shawn worked with a heavy metal band local to the Albuquerque, New
Mexico area that were looking to increase their online presence. Over the course of eight weeks
they developed a project proposal, requirements document, and architectural design document to
capture the band's vision and make it a working application.
</br>
</br>
The application was coded in Java with the Spring Boot framework and MySQL as the backing database.
The site presents a simplified layout for fans to quickly obtain the most common information
about the band from the main page. This information includes band discography, work in progress,
links to available music, videos and merchandise, and upcoming events. Information is presented
dynamically to the front page allowing band members to update the information through secure
administrative tools with instant results.
</br>
</br>
Along with providing information for the fans, the application provides booking capabilities,
album and event management, and administrative functions. The project can be viewed at the above
link for the application or the GitHub repository.
